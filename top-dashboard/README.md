### Grid-based Admin Panel Mock Up Project for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard)

Finishing off this section, again. Back-tracking has been good and found that I was a little weaker on CSS grid than I thought.

So, there is a loose (not pixel-perfect) image that we are to use as a basic template and we are asked to use both grid and flex appropriately to layout the desktop (non-responsive) version of the layout. Pretty straight forward. You can learn more at [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard)

Probably not going to go further with this particular project once complete although a similar project with more bells and whistles will likely happen at a later date.

Until then, thank you for reading and have a wonderful day!
